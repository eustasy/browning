Browning: A Mailgun Script
=========================

Browning is a tiny PHP function to send emails with Mailgun, that uses CURL instead of Mailgun's (slightly porky) library.

If available, you should run the following on your server fr the best possible results and garunteed (not garunteed) results. `sudo apt-get install libmagic-dev php5-dev libcurl3 php5-curl`
